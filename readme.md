## Description

Treasury allows you to receive and manage donations through PayPal.

Even though this mod has been thoroughly tested, you should still use 
good practices like backing up your site and database before installing. 
	
I repeat this again because this is true for any mod you install! 
- ensure you first have backups of your files and database.

Once you have installed the package, 
click on the Treasury link under Admin "Configuration" options, 
then follow the setup and operational instructions.
