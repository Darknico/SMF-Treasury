You must first reverse any manual changes you made to Modifications.english.php.

You must run Uninstall before upgrading so that all existing Treasury changes and files can be removed.
Note: for theme changes, Uninstall will only modify the default theme.
Any manual changes you made to other themes you must manually reverse yourself.

To avoid any warnings below, it is recommended that you first uninstall mods added after Treasury,
and uninstall them in the REVERSE ORDER that you installed them.
index.php?action=packages;sa=installed shows the order in which you installed.

If you do have warnings below, continuing the uninstall process WILL create issues with your site.
Use the Package Parser and check the "Uninstall" option to provide guidelines to manual removal of Treasury.
Then determine what caused this issue and fix that.

NOTE: Uninstall will deliberately NOT remove the Treasury database tables.
For permanent Uninstall you will need to manually DROP these tables from the database:
- smf_log_treasurey
- smf_treas_config
- smf_treas_donations
- smf_treas_events
- smf_treas_prizes
- smf_treas_registry
- smf_treas_subscribers
- smf_treas_targets
(assumes you used smf_ for your prefix)
